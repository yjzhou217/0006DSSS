    "# London Fire Brigade Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The London Fire Brigade (LFB) provides an open dataset containing\n",
    "information about multi-year fire incidents and fire engine moblisations\n",
    "in London. The fire incident dataset includes various details such as\n",
    "the location, time, and type of fire incidents, which can be useful for\n",
    "various analyses, including supervised learning tasks. The original\n",
    "dataset is available at\n",
    "[here](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-incident-records-em8xy/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we’ve processed and saved a subset of the LFB incident\n",
    "dataset in 2023 as `LFB_2023_daily_data.csv` (containing aggregated\n",
    "daily callouts in London) and `LFB_2023_data.csv` (containing individual\n",
    "incident information). The Python notebook for processing the original\n",
    "dataset is available\n",
    "[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huanfachen/DSSS_2025/refs/heads/main/data/processing_LFB_data.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worthwhile reading the\n",
    "[metadata](https://data.london.gov.uk/download/em8xy/cb9d6550-e502-40a9-a5e4-1f055f31316f/Metadata.xlsx)\n",
    "before formatting a problem. The following are some key points to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The `IncidentGroup` column indicates the high-level incident type\n",
    "    and consists of the following categories: `False Alarm`, `Fire`,\n",
    "    `Special Service`. The ‘special service’ type refers to non-fire\n",
    "    incidents, including assistance to other emergency services, such as\n",
    "    helping with moving larger (i.e. bariatric) patients/people or\n",
    "    rescuing people from lifts/elevators. The `False Alarm` type refers\n",
    "    to fire callouts where no actual fire or emergency was present, and\n",
    "    is further divided into three subtypes, including `AFA`,\n",
    "    `False alarm - Good intent`, and `False alarm - Malicious` (see\n",
    "    `StopCodeDescription` column). Obviously, if your research question\n",
    "    is about fire incidents or fire risk, you should only focus on the\n",
    "    `Fire` and `False Alarm` types in this column and remove\n",
    "    `Special Service` type.\n",
    "2.  The location precision of incidents at Dwellings (i.e. residential\n",
    "    buildings) is limited to the postcode district level (e.g. N2) for\n",
    "    data privacy reasons. Therefore, the columns of `Postcode_full`,\n",
    "    `UPRN`, `Easting_m`, `Northing_m`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude` are\n",
    "    redacted or removed for Dwellings. This means that if you want to\n",
    "    conduct geospatial analysis at a fine spatial resolution\n",
    "    (e.g. building or street level), you should exclude incidents at\n",
    "    Dwellings. If you want to conduct geospatial analysis for all\n",
    "    incidents (including Dwellings), you should use spatial\n",
    "    granularities coarser than postcode district level (e.g. boroughs,\n",
    "    the whole London).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stakeholders of fire service research\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to consider the potential stakeholders who might benefit\n",
    "from the insights derived from (geospatial) research of fire services.\n",
    "As far as I know, potential stakeholders include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Local fire services including London Fire Brigade. Each fire service\n",
    "    department has their data analyst and GIS team. They would be\n",
    "    interested in understanding the patterns and trends of fire\n",
    "    incidents to improve resource allocation, response times, and\n",
    "    overall effectiveness of fire services. So far, the UK fire services\n",
    "    don’t have lots of collaborations with academic researchers. If they\n",
    "    need GIS expertise, they always outsource to private companies, such\n",
    "    as [Cadcorp](https://www.cadcorp.com/) and\n",
    "    [ORH](https://www.orhltd.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC, [link](https://nfcc.org.uk/)).\n",
    "    NFCC is a non-charity body representing Fire & Rescue Services at a\n",
    "    national level and, as the professional voice of the fire and rescue\n",
    "    service and aim for maximum impact. They strive to harness knowledge\n",
    "    and expertise from across the country, bringing it together for the\n",
    "    benefit of all.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The LFB dataset can be used to formulate various supervised learning\n",
    "tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Regression\n",
    "    -   Predicting daily LFB callouts in the whole London or each\n",

    "-   Classification\n",
    "    -   Predicting whether a fire incident is a false alarm given the\n",
    "        location available at the time of the callout, which includes\n",
    "        time of day, day of week, postcode district, building type\n",
